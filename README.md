| File                        | Description                                                                |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `get_next_line.c`           | Contains the main implementation of the `get_next_line` function.          |
| `get_next_line.h`           | Header file for the function, declaring necessary prototypes.              |
| `get_next_line_bonus.c`     | Bonus version of `get_next_line` (supports multiple file descriptors).      |
| `get_next_line_bonus.h`     | Header file for the bonus version.                                         |
| `get_next_line_utils.c`     | Contains utility functions used in `get_next_line`.                        |
| `get_next_line_utils_bonus.c` | Utility functions for the bonus version.                                 |

## üîß Usage

### Compilation

To compile the project, use a compiler like `gcc`. Below are typical commands:

#### Basic Version:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c -o gnl
```
#### Bonus Version:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 get_next_line_bonus.c get_next_line_utils_bonus.c -o gnl_bonus
```
#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The BUFFER_SIZE macro must be defined at compile time to specify the buffer size.

#### Example Execution
```bash
./gnl < file.txt
```
#### Expected Function
```c
char *get_next_line(int fd);
```
#### Parameters:
fd: The file descriptor to read from.
#### Returns:
A string containing the next line, or NULL on error or EOF.
